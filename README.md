# Project Title

Dataflow

# Description

These lines of code were written to analyse ASF, WNF, and CWD from different public domain databases as described in this report for WiLiMan_ID. The R code is intended to ensure the reproducibility of the results or, with slight modification, to be applied to other diseases in the databases used. R Code written by Ofosuhene O. Apenteng.

## Getting Started

# Executing program

#Read of data 

#link to where files are - the below code will pick the newest file in the folder"

#Clear and prepare data

#make sure that the outbreak start date is in date format
#filter out other diseases than WNF, ASF, and CWD

#filter out other species than birds using the bird_names_20220517.csv file

#we only want data from Europe (so filter using the europe shapefile) and data between 2018 and 2023 where the period we are using is five years interval

#For birds only

#We needed to represent spatial vector data to include points (coordinates),

#-Remove these countries because we noticed that it was not part of Corine land cover

#-Empres_I--from different database

#Renaming

#we only want data from Europe (so filter using the europe shapefile) and data from 2018 and onwards

#pass them into the function as the `coords` parameter

#Remove these countries because we noticed that it was not part of Corine land cover (eg. "Ukraine", "Russian Federation", "Belarus")
#-Merging these two database

#Remove the NA's

#We needed to represent spatial vector data to include points (coordinates), in view of that we added their latitude and longitude
#For birds only
#For wild horses only
#For pigs only

#Read in the (a)biotic factors (download)

#-Plots

#Extract raster values to point locations of the (a)biotic factors using the terra package 

#Univariate regression analysis to check for significance by negative binomial regression 
#Multivariate regression analysis for negative binomial regression 

#Time series analysis

#set all cases to 1, so we are counting the number of outbreaks instead of the number of birds affected

#Dates and week numbers are tricky as they differ from year to year. Here we use iso 8601 to create the new variables - isoweek and isoyear

#check if any observations with week 53?

#The data was converted into weekly bases. Take note here based on you want one can convert it to want eh or she want. 

#Now aggregate per week per year per country

#These methods fill in missing years for each country, by adding week 1 of the missing year (zero number of detections)

#Create data, neighborhood and covariate matrices

#first read in shapefile where water is added as polygons to account for countries with water between them still being connected in a (species you want to use) perspective

#now calculate the neighborhood (matrix) and set column and row names

#Now only keep countries in the neighborhood matrix where we have outbreak data and remove the newly created water connections as well

#create a shape file with only countries where we have data - this is needed for the model

#convert sf object europeanCountries.sub to spatialpolygon dataframe as the sts class needs this format

#Make sure that the country order in the data matrix we will create is the same as in the neighborhood matrix

#create a data matrix to be used in the model
